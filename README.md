# Webpack Config Generator
Webpack Config Generator - an npm package to create your own webpack configuration. Supports React, Vue and custom configuration.
This project is inspired by https://createapp.dev

# Usage
## Install package globally
```
npm i -g wcg
```

## Add webpack to existing project
In your project's directory, run:
```
wcg
```

## Initialise new project with webpack
To initialise a new project with webpack config, run:
```
wcg --output=PROJECT_NAME
```
It will create a new directory with the given name and initialises webpack files in it.

# Report bugs
The package is under continuous development and I am trying my best to spot bugs and resolve them. If you find any bug, feel free to raise an issue [here](https://github.com/sarthak-sehgal/wcg/issues).
