# WCG
Webpack Config Generator - an npm package to create your own webpack configuration. Supports React, Vue and custom configuration.
This project is inspired by https://createapp.dev

# Usage
In your project's directory, run:
```
npm i -g wcg
wcg
```

# Options
To initialise a new project with webpack config, run:
```
wcg --output=PROJECT_NAME
```
This creates a new directory with the given name and initialises webpack files in it.
